# Speech Emotion Recognition

<h2>Speech Emotion Recognition using Bi-Directional LSTM</h2>

Speech is unique, it is generated by communicative intentions of the speaker to whom they talk to. The speaker cannot hide their emotion from their voice except they pretend to do it. So, we can use a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER), a computational method to recognize human emotion from the speech sound. Our SER system will categorize the speech as per six categories of emotions; “Sadness”, “Love”, “Anger”, “Joy”, “Fear”, and “Surprise”.
